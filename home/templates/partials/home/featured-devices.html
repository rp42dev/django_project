    <p class="gray medium-text right">
      Your website will work on any device, whether it's a desktop computer, a
      tablet, or a smartphone. It doesn't matter what size screen you're using - your website will look and function
      great. And responsive design means that your website will automatically adjust to fit the screen size and
      orientation of the device you're using. This ensures that your website always looks great and is easy to use, no
      matter what device you're using.</p>
