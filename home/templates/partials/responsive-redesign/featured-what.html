    <p class="gray medium-text right">
      Having a mobile-friendly website isn't just about making your site look pretty on a phone screen. It's about
      creating a
      seamless user experience that draws people in and keeps them engaged. And that's where I come in. I can take your
      current website and tailor it to fit any device, from smartphones to tablets to desktops, without sacrificing any
      of the
      design elements or functionality.
